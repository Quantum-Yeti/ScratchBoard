    {
        "name": "Server Ping / Latency",
        "range": "< 50 ms",
        "symptoms": "Lag, rubberbanding, delayed actions",
        "explanation": "The time it takes for data to travel from your device to the server and back. High latency increases input delay and can disrupt gameplay.",
        "steps": "Switch to a server closer to your location, use a wired connection for better stability, and close bandwidth-heavy applications that may interfere with your connection."
    },
    {
        "name": "Server Tick Rate",
        "range": "30–128 Hz",
        "symptoms": "Hit registration issues, lag spikes, inconsistent gameplay",
        "explanation": "The frequency at which the server updates the game state. A lower tick rate results in more noticeable delays in updates, making gameplay feel sluggish.",
        "steps": "Check the server's tick rate in game settings or documentation. If possible, prefer servers with higher tick rates for smoother gameplay."
    },
    {
        "name": "Server Load / Player Count",
        "range": "Varies by game",
        "symptoms": "Lag, delayed spawns, desynchronization (desync)",
        "explanation": "High player counts or server overloads can cause delays in processing actions, leading to lag and gameplay issues.",
        "steps": "Avoid peak gaming hours, or choose servers with lower player populations to reduce load and improve performance."
    },
    {
        "name": "Server Maintenance / Updates",
        "range": "N/A",
        "symptoms": "Temporary disconnects, server downtime",
        "explanation": "Scheduled maintenance or patch updates may cause temporary server unavailability or connectivity issues.",
        "steps": "Check official game forums, social media, or server status pages for scheduled maintenance or ongoing updates."
    },
    {
        "name": "Server Location / Region",
        "range": "Closest region",
        "symptoms": "High ping, input delay, lag",
        "explanation": "The physical distance between your location and the server affects latency. The farther the server, the higher the ping.",
        "steps": "Always connect to the nearest available server region for optimal performance. Enable region selection in game settings if available."
    },
    {
        "name": "Server Network Quality",
        "range": "Stable connection",
        "symptoms": "Packet loss, rubberbanding, disconnects",
        "explanation": "Issues on the server's network, such as packet loss or poor routing, can result in dropped or delayed packets, causing lag and rubberbanding.",
        "steps": "Report the issue to the game developer or server admin. Monitor the server's status page for ongoing issues or outages."
    },
    {
        "name": "Server Capacity / Matchmaking Queue",
        "range": "Varies by game",
        "symptoms": "Long queue times, slow match start, server overcrowding",
        "explanation": "When too many players try to join the same server, it can cause long wait times and delays in match starting.",
        "steps": "Try joining different servers or play during off-peak hours to reduce queue times. Consider playing a different mode or region if wait times are consistently long."
